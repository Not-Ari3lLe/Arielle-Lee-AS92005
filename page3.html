<h2> It's time to act!</h2>

<p> We encourage young adults to contribute and spread the word of Kaitiakitanga</p>

<p>Kaitiakitanga: Guardianship and Protection</p>
<p>Kaitiakitanga is a Maori term that means Guardianship and protection. (How we manage the environment, our responsibility and sustainability of the environment)</p>


<p> A few ways we can do to contribute to deforestation are:</p>
<p>- Spreading Information about Deforestation to others and the potential consequences acting towards deforestation </p>
<p>- Joining / Engaging in sustainable programs</p>
