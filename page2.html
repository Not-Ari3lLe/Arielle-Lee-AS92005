 <h1>Environmental issues of deforestation</h1>

<p> Deforestation can cause multiple problems like climate change, also contributing to global warming.</p><!-- this is a paragraph-->
<p>This also affects the water cycle, damaging natural habitats (habitat loss to animals that lives in the forest) as well with soil erosion.</p><!-- this is a paragraph-->
<p></p>
<p> Deforestation can cause air pollution to become worse, also increases the risk of pandemics.</p><!-- this is a paragraph-->
<br>
<p> Deforestation will not only affect the environment and habitat loss, but this can negatively impact on our daily lives. <br> We depend on these natural resources, we need trees to live.</p> <!-- this is a paragraph-->
<br>
<br>
    <h2>what causes deforestation?</h2>
<br>

<p>Trees are cut down to provide for more land / space for us, some examples are: Housing, (to build houses, apartments and factories) <br> Fuel, (used for cooking and other things) and lastly; Furniture & paper (cutting down trees gives us wood to build furniture and paper.)</p>

    <br>
<p> sometimes this happens by its natural causes, like fires that occurs naturally that happens because of extreme heat, flooding and drought.
