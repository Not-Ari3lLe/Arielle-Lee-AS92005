 <h1>Environmental issues of deforestation</h1><!-- <h1> meaning Heading one, the most important heading and which appears the biggest. -->

<p> Deforestation can cause multiple problems like climate change, also contributing to global warming.</p><!-- this is a paragraph-->
<p>This also affects the water cycle, damaging natural habitats (habitat loss to animals that lives in the forest) as well with soil erosion.</p><!-- this is a paragraph-->
<p> Deforestation can cause air pollution to become worse, also increases the risk of pandemics.</p><!-- this is a paragraph-->
<br><!-- breaks my sentence and puts it into a new line below my text or making spaces for my sentences -->
<p> Deforestation will not only affect the environment and habitat loss, but this can negatively impact on our daily lives. <br> We depend on these natural resources, we need trees to live.</p> <!-- this is a paragraph-->

    <h2>what causes deforestation?</h2> <!-- <h2> is the second most important heading. -->
<br> <!-- breaks my sentence and puts it into a new line below my text or making spaces for my sentences -->

<p>Trees are cut down to provide for more land / space for us, some examples are: Housing, (to build houses, apartments and factories) <br> Fuel, (used for cooking and other things) and lastly; Furniture & paper (cutting down trees gives us wood to build furniture and paper.)</p>

    <br><!-- breaks my sentence and puts it into a new line below my text or making spaces for my sentences -->
<p> sometimes this happens by its natural causes, like fires that occurs naturally that happens because of extreme heat, flooding and drought.
