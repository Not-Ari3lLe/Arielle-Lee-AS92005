    <h1>Deforestation NZ</h1> <!-- <h1> meaning Heading one, the most important heading and which appears the biggest. -->
    <p>Deforestation happens when people cut down or clear trees in forests over a large area. <br>(this site contains information about deforestation and more!)</p> <!-- this is a paragraph-->

    <p>Deforestation is a big issue because it harms the environment and animals that are adapted in the forest. </p><!-- this is a paragraph-->
    <p>About us: our mission is to provide safe and effective strategies to stop deforestation, <br> also spreading the word kaitiakitanga around us to encourage everyone that are interested to step in.</p><!-- this is a paragraph-->
